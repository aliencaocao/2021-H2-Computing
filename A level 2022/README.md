#### Note: Everything in this repository is unofficial and is not endorsed by the SEAB nor any school teacher/personnel from MOE. These are made solely by a student who have taken the exam and are made public purely and only for educational purposes. I do not guarantee the accuracy and correctness of this solution, but I tried my best to ensure it.

Question paper can be found ~~in commit history~~ due to IP issues.

Comments are omitted unless absolutely necessary for educational purposes. Do note that to score full mark for "good coding practices", you have to add a lot more comments than I did in this solution set. There were also some code that provides little educational value that are omitted but still **required** in actual exam (e.g. class attribute getters and setters, automated testing). I left comments in places where I omitted such code.

All files and folders are named following the requirements of the paper (excluding my name, center number and index number for obvious reason). To aid in testing and learning, I created dummy files following the format of the provided files for Tasks 1.3 and 4.4. Note that these files are in a similar format to the actual files provided during the exam but does not contain as much data.
