    "### Access modifiers \n",
    "\n",
    "Access modifiers (or access specifiers) are keywords in object-oriented languages that set the accessibility of classes, methods, and other members. Access modifiers are a specific part of programming language syntax used to facilitate the encapsulation of components.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  In Python, everything is Public\n",
    "\n",
    "All methods and attributes in Python class are *public*, i.e. they can be accessed by users. \n",
    "* Python has **NO access modifier**, i.e. `public` & `protected` & `private`, like in C# or Java.\n",
    "* It's a convention to prefix a instance variable with `_` to indicate a method or an attribute is only for internal use. \n",
    "* Such methods and attributes should not be used directly by users of the class. But you can still access them directly, which is useful for debugging purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Double_leading_and_trailing_underscore\n",
    "\n",
    "Python use this convention for special variables or methods (so-called “magic method”) such as `__init__()`. \n",
    "* These methods provides special syntactic features or does special things. \n",
    "* User might modify such special method in rare case. E.g. You customize `__init__()` to initialize an object.\n",
    "* User should not define his own method in such convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single-leading-underscore \n",
    "\n",
    "Single leading underscores is a **convention** to indicate an attribute is for internal use or treated as non-public. For example, user of a class `A` should not be using `A._attr` directly because `_attr` is meant for internal use in class. \n",
    "* This is a convention only and it does not affect the behavior of your programs. \n",
    "* The single-leading underscore is meant as a hint to another programmer that the variable or method starting with a single underscore is intended for internal use. It should be considered an implementation detail and subject to change without notice.\n",
    "* This isn’t enforced by Python. Python does not have strong distinctions between “private” and “public” variables like Java does.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Double-leading-underscore\n",
    "\n",
    "When a class attribute is named with double-leading-underscore, it invokes **name mangling**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Name Mangling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Name Mangling** is a process where if a method has **at least two underscores leading the name and at the most one underscore trailing the name**, Python interpretor will textually replaced with *_ClassName* before it.\n",
    "For example, *__method()* becomes *_ClassName*__method()*. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Example* `__foo` in class `MyClass` will become `_MyClass__foo`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Name Mangling is primarily done to avoid accidents of overriding the methods of parent classes by inherited classes.**\n",
